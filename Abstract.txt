Fake news poses a significant threat to information credibility on digital platforms, necessitating reliable automated detection systems. This project presents the development of a Fake News Detection framework using Natural Language Processing and supervised machine learning techniques. News articles are preprocessed through tokenization, stopword elimination, and lemmatization to normalize textual content. TF-IDF vectorization is employed to represent textual features numerically. Multiple classifiers, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, are trained and comparatively evaluated. Performance is analyzed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, revealing notable variations across models in handling ambiguous and borderline cases. The results demonstrate that while traditional NLP-based models achieve high classification performance, they remain sensitive to linguistic nuances and dataset bias. This work highlights both the effectiveness and limitations of classical machine learning approaches for fake news detection and provides practical insights into real-world text classification challenges.
